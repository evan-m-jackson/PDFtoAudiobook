# PDFtoAudiobook

This program allows the user to take a pdf file and create an mp3 file (aka 'Audiobook').

# How it Works

In order for the program to run, you will need to have Python3 installed.  I suggest downloading the latest version at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Assuming that the user has python installed, the first thing would be to download the code off of GitHub.  After it is finished downloading, I recommend putting the project
folder on the Desktop just to make finding it easier.

Next open a Terminal window and open the project folder.  If I saved the file on my Desktop then I would enter the following commands:

    cd Desktop
    cd PDFtoAudiobook
